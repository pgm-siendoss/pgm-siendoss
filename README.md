- Hi, Iâ€™m Sienna Dossche, student at Graduaat Programmeren/Course Programming in Ghent.
- Iâ€™m currently learning to code, so most of the projects you'll find below are school assignments.
- But as I learn more, you'll see more of my work!ðŸŒ±
- I'm very excited to show more and learn more.
- If you want to contact me you can do so here or on my LinkedIn profile.
- Thanks for reading!
